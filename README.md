# Ze Moulinette!

Hello. If you're looking for beautiful code, please leave.

This repository is somehow one of my playground.

## WTF?

This stuff make you earn some seconds during Isograd contests.

## Ze Lazy Dude

Ok! So, when you checkout this, basically, you have about nothing that will help you resolve Isograd exercises.

Let's be clear: it will NOT help you with the algorithms and other constraints, that's just something else.

## Yeah.

You get a bunch of 7 directories (because Isograd contests is at last 7 exercices AFAIK), and each directory is made of 4 files.

- answer.php contains your solution (oops, if you don't code in PHP, you basically know what to do right now)

- debug.php contains my built-in functions that can help sometimes (most often the "between" function). When you deal with hardcore recursivity, the C stuff it contains to run C after subscribing for coding in PHP works well. It can also help when you need to debug... in a way

- prepare.php will look in your ~/Downloads/ directory for isograd ".zip" files (what? you don't have that directory?). It will nicely move, unzip & delete it. That's all. And you're ready to read the next line of this file.

- diff.php does the magic even if it's coded quite uglily: you just run php diff.php and the command will show as much "SUCCESS" as you have tests file (uncompressed using the above command)... or will somehow display "FAILED" with a bunch of explainations. Everything is in "error.(exercise number).log", though.

## Cool?

That's all. I've also programmed a bunch of macros on my keyboard to earn more seconds. The whole stuff would work better if my brains were following! Anyway :P

Bisous
